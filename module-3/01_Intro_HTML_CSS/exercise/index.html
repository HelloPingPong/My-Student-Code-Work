          <h2><u>Let 'em know</u></h2>
          <p>The Cleveland Cavaliers are a storied franchise and are well known for being the team that drafted a generational 
              talent in Lebron James back in 2003. They won the 2016 NBA championship and ended an infamous sports curse on the city that had lasted 
              over 50 years. After 4 straight years of finals appearances, Lebron left for L.A. in 2018.
              The GM, Koby Altman, managed to draft and trade well and has transformed the team from a garbage fire in 2018
              into a top 5 team in the league after only 5 years time. After clinching a playoff spot in 2023, the Cavs are set to make real noise in 
              the playoffs this year now that they are lead by the young core of Darius Garland, Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley, and Jarret Allen.</p>
